Version 1.2.0


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use feature::qw_comments;
    
    @a = qw(
       foo  # Now with comments!
       bar
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows comments are inside of C<qw()>.


=head2 C<< use feature::qw_comments; >>

=head2 C<< no feature::qw_comments; >>

The standard C<qw()> syntax is restored until the end of the current lexical scope.


=head1 WARNING: Uses Experimental Features

This module relies on the experimental keyword plugin and lexer interface features which "may change or be removed without notice".


=head1 WARNING: Re-implements parts of Perl

This feature is implemented by completely replacing the parser/compiler's handling of C<qw()> when the pragma is in effect.
There may be discrepencies in how certain edge cases are handled, and new discrepencies may surface as Perl changes over time.
Please contact me or file a bug report if you encounter any discrepencies.
