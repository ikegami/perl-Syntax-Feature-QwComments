=head1 NAME

Syntax::Feature::QwComments - Pragma to allow comments in qw()


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.17


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use syntax qw( qw_comments );

    my @a = qw(
       foo  # Now with comments!
       bar
    );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Syntax::Feature::QwComments is a lexically-scoped pragma that
allows comments inside of C<qw()>.

C<qw()> should work identically with and without this pragma
in all other respects except one: In addition to escaping delimiters
and itself, C<\> will escape C<#>.

This module was formerly known as feature::qw_comments.


=head2 C<< use syntax qw( qw_comments ); >>

=head2 C<< use Syntax::Feature::QwComments; >>

Allow comments inside of C<qw()> until the end of the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<< no syntax qw( qw_comments ); >>

=head2 C<< no Syntax::Feature::QwComments; >>

The standard C<qw()> syntax is restored until the end of the current lexical scope.
